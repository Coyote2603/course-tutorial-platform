# Adapting the platform

The platform separates identity, educational content, and rendering logic. Most course adaptations should stay in `js/site-config.js` and `js/content.js`. This keeps upgrades manageable and makes it easy to compare your course-specific changes with improvements to the shared infrastructure.

## 1. Set the course identity

`js/site-config.js` exposes one global `SITE_CONFIG` object.

| Key | Purpose | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `siteTitle` | Browser and document title | Use the public name of the site. |
| `shortTitle` | Compact navigation brand | Keep it short enough for a phone-width header. |
| `courseTitle` | Main dashboard heading | Name the course, program, or learning sequence. |
| `courseSubtitle` | Dashboard explanation | State what learners will do or gain. |
| `instructorName` | Instructor or team credit | Use a public professional name or a neutral team label. |
| `institutionName` | Optional institution label | Leave as `""` to omit it. Use a name only with permission. |
| `footerText` | Footer attribution or context | Keep it concise and suitable for every page. |
| `theme.primary` | Main interface color | Use a six-digit hexadecimal color with strong contrast. |
| `theme.accent` | Highlight and action color | Check contrast in buttons, badges, and focus states. |
| `theme.accentText` | Accessible accent text on light surfaces | Choose a darker companion to `theme.accent` with at least 4.5:1 contrast against white. |
| `features.showGame` | Show or hide the game entry point | Use `true` or `false`, without quotation marks. |
| `game.title` | Public game-card title | Change the label without changing the game itself. |
| `game.description` | Public game-card summary | Explain the activity in one or two sentences. |
| `game.href` | Game-page URL | Keep `newsvendor-game.html` unless linking elsewhere. |
| `game.duration` | Expected completion time | Give learners a realistic estimate. |

The objects are frozen to prevent accidental runtime mutation. Edit the source values directly and preserve `Object.freeze(...)`.

## 2. Choose a visual identity

Start with the three theme colors. `primary` and `accent` drive the main interface, while `accentText` keeps small accent labels readable on light surfaces. The Newsvendor game deliberately retains its own teal teaching palette in `css/game.css`; edit those `--game-*` tokens separately only if you want to restyle the game. Review every page after changing colors.

A usable theme should:

- preserve readable text and control contrast;
- avoid using color as the only signal;
- maintain visible keyboard focus;
- work on projector screens as well as laptops; and
- remain legible for common forms of color-vision deficiency.

If you add a logo or photograph, use an asset you own or have permission to redistribute. Record its source and license in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` when appropriate. Do not copy an institutional mark from a private site merely because you teach there.

## 3. The sample session sequence

The five synthetic sessions demonstrate one possible arc:

| Pattern | Teaching purpose | Possible adaptations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Concepts and Vocabulary | Establish a shared language | Definitions in law, constructs in research methods, symbols in engineering |
| Worked Example | Make expert reasoning visible | Statistical derivation, accounting calculation, clinical reasoning vignette |
| Decision Lab | Require a choice before feedback | Forecast, diagnosis, design selection, interpretation exercise |
| Applied Case | Combine evidence and action | Policy memo, product decision, ethical analysis, field scenario |
| Review Workshop | Retrieve, connect, and transfer | Exam review, capstone synthesis, professional certification practice |

This arc can be retained, repeated across modules, or replaced entirely. In the sample, each session object corresponds to one learner-facing destination.

## 4. Replace the sample content

Edit the `SESSIONS` array in `js/content.js`. Each session can combine:

- learning objectives;
- concept cards;
- a diagram or visual model;
- public or LMS-hosted materials;
- multi-part problems with revealable feedback;
- readings; and
- interactive slides with optional hints.

The [Content model](CONTENT_MODEL.md) gives the exact shape and a copyable starter object. The optional [notes on the sample sessions](TEACHING_DESIGN_GUIDE.md) explain how this demonstration combines the components.

## 5. Handle materials deliberately

A material link can point to either a public asset or an authenticated destination.

### Public materials

Repository-local resources are suitable only when all of the following are true:

- the file was created for public release or has a compatible redistribution license;
- it contains no student data, answer key, confidential case information, or hidden metadata;
- its source and attribution are documented; and
- its size and extension pass the public-boundary policy.

The template uses small HTML samples because they are easy to inspect in code review. Common office files, archives, and videos are prohibited by default.

### Restricted materials

Keep restricted documents, recordings, datasets, and solutions in an authenticated LMS or server-side protected system. Add only an HTTPS link and describe the sign-in requirement in the material's `description`.

Do not rely on:

- an unlisted URL;
- JavaScript that hides a link;
- a password or password hash stored in the repository;
- a query-string token;
- `robots.txt`; or
- a repository being difficult to discover.

Those measures do not protect files served by a public static host.

## 6. Adapt the Newsvendor game

If inventory decision-making fits your course, the complete game can be used unchanged. You can alter the framing, numeric profiles, or scenario order by following [Newsvendor game](NEWSVENDOR_GAME.md) and rerunning `npm test`.

If the game is unrelated, set `features.showGame` to `false`. Keeping the game files in the repository still allows you to turn it on later or share its direct public URL.

## 7. Extend to another discipline

The infrastructure does not assume operations management. A few mappings illustrate the range:

- **Research methods:** concepts become identification terms, problems become interpretation tasks, and hints reveal diagnostic questions.
- **Finance:** diagrams show cash-flow timing, problems reveal calculation steps, and presenter slides stage a valuation discussion.
- **Marketing:** sessions move from constructs to segmentation practice, then to a fictional launch decision.
- **Strategy:** concept cards define frameworks, problems ask for evidence-based choices, and an applied case ends with implementation risks.
- **Medicine or public health:** fictional vignettes support structured reasoning, provided the site clearly states that examples are educational and not clinical advice.
- **Engineering:** diagrams show system structure, problems expose units and assumptions, and hints target common model-selection errors.
- **Humanities:** concept cards define analytical lenses, problems compare interpretations, and revealable feedback models textual reasoning using public-domain or properly licensed excerpts.

The included examples emphasize interaction, but the same components can also support more reading-focused approaches.

## 8. Optional approach for easier upgrades

When possible:

- restrict course-specific edits to `js/site-config.js`, `js/content.js`, and clearly licensed assets;
- avoid renaming renderer fields;
- document any structural changes;
- preserve validation scripts; and
- merge infrastructure updates separately from content revisions.

This separation makes it easier to bring accessibility, browser-compatibility, and game improvements from the public project into a course adaptation.
